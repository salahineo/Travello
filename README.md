Here is some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how i make it in the source code (use comments to reach this section)
- Extract code of specific section and use it in your project
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects
- Edit on this project after study its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages
